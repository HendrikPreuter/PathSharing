<p><b>A word from the creators</b><br><br>

    We are a group of students with a passionate love for role-playing games.
    We mainly play using the rules for pathfinder.
    We have played a lot over the past year and these were some of the most fun times we have had in years.
    We always used google drive for the sharing and maintaining of information like:the general outline of a session, keeping track of the xp gained, character backgrounds etc.
    However this medium is not the best for us.

    During our study an opportunity arose to combine our love for the hobby with the study, so we took it.
    We decided to make our own file sharing system that would be tailored to our needs.
    We hope that you will be as happy as we are with the service we can provide and decide to sign up and get involved.
    <br>
    We wish to you epic adventures filled with treasure and wonderful experiences,
    <br>
    The development team
