        This site has been developed to help role-playing groups keep their files organised.
        For the GM it's simple to give information to certain players as he or she can share this file.

    <p>
        <br><b>What is role-playing?</b> <br>
        <br>
        Role-playing is a fun and social activity where you come together in a group of usually four to fife players.
        One of these player takes on the role as game master (also known as: dungeon master or story-teller), this player will create a world for the other players to have adventures.
        The gm sets the scenes by describing what the players see, smell hear and feel.
        Much like the descriptions that can be found in books, hence the term story-teller.
        The gm also plays all the non-player-characters(NPCs) the players can interact with.
    </p>
    <p>
        <br><b>Usefull links and tips</b> <br>

        <br><br>
    The website
    <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/">d20pfsrd.com</a>
    contains a lot of information about the game, from pre-generated npc's to information about the character creation process.
    <br><br>
    For creating a character we recommend you use
    <a href="http://pcgen.org/">pcgen</a>
    because it is an easy to uderstand programm and it helps you a lot by showing what you can and can't do while creating. It also shows a list of the things you still need to do to finnish your character. Leveling up the character is also no problem.
